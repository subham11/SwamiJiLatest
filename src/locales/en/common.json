This can manifest as Pitru Dosha (ancestral affliction) in the horoscopes of descendants, causing obstacles in marriage, progeny, health, and overall prosperity.",
    "paragraph3": "The Narayan Bali ritual is performed by invoking Lord Vishnu (Narayan) and making offerings to satisfy the unfulfilled desires of departed souls. The ceremony involves the creation of symbolic bodies using darbha grass, followed by the complete funeral rites including mantras, offerings, and final immersion.",

This powerful ceremony addresses the unfulfilled desires and grievances of departed souls that may be affecting the current generation.",
    "paragraph2": "According to Garuda Purana and other Hindu scriptures, when Shradh rituals are not performed regularly or are conducted improperly, the ancestors' souls remain unsatisfied.

    "paragraph3": "The word 'Tripindi' comes from 'Tri' meaning three and 'Pinda' meaning rice balls offered to ancestors. During this ritual, three pindas are offered simultaneously to three generations of ancestors, along with tarpan (water offerings), mantras, and homa (sacred fire ceremony). This consolidated ritual is considered equivalent to performing individual Shradh for each ancestor.",

    "paragraph1": "Pitr Shanti Poojan is a sacred Vedic ritual performed to pacify, satisfy, and bring relief to all ancestral souls – not limited to a specific lineage or generation. Unlike Shraddh which is performed on specific dates or Tripindi which focuses on three generations, Pitr Shanti is a universal ceremony to address the dissatisfaction of any and all deceased ancestors whose presence may be causing problems or disturbances in the family.",
    "paragraph2": "This powerful ritual is based on the principle that unsatisfied or angry ancestors (Pitri Dosha) can negatively influence their descendants' lives in various ways. When ancestral debts remain unpaid or when proper rituals are neglected, the spirits may cause obstacles in marriage, career, health, finances, relationships, and overall prosperity of the family.",
    "whyTitle": "Why Perform Pitr Shanti Poojan?",
    "paragraph3": "According to the Garuda Purana and other Hindu scriptures, the souls of deceased family members who are not properly honored through rituals remain in a state of dissatisfaction. They may linger in the earthly realm, unable to progress to their rightful destination. In their frustration, they may interfere with the lives of their descendants, creating obstacles and suffering.",
    "paragraph4": "Pitr Shanti Poojan addresses these issues by performing comprehensive rituals including sacred invocations (Mantras), offerings of water (Tarpan), food offerings (Bali), and fire ceremonies (Havan). The ritual seeks to fulfill the unfulfilled wishes of the ancestors and grant them peace, thereby liberating both the souls of the ancestors and their descendants from the burden of unresolved ancestral karma.",
